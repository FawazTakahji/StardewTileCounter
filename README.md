## Building
The mod build package should be able to locate your game folder automatically, if it cant find it or if you want to specify it manually, edit the csproj file like so:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    ...
    <GamePath>Your Game Path</GamePath>
    ...
</PropertyGroup>
```
If you want to set this path for all projects, create a file called `stardewvalley.targets` in your home folder (`%userprofile%` | `~`) and add the following:
```xml
<Project>
   <PropertyGroup>
      <GamePath>Your Game Path</GamePath>
   </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

You should now be able to build and debug the mod using your IDE
